yall dont be sad that they never end up together. be happy that they finally ended up in their afterlife live where they wont feel tired and pain loving each other. they will continue their pure true lovestory there
I dont think I can ever recover from this...I knew they never gonna hve their happy ending but it still hurts to see scene!!
"JTBC I beg you, more drama/movie/variety show starring Haein & Jisoo please.. I can't get enough of this couple. Their chemistry is really amazing. Even if they only look at each others eyes, its already giving me butterflies"
"I don't get it why some people ""hate"" this masterpiece. Cinematography, emotions, and fashion are on point."
"theres definitely an inside joke between the two of them about the superman scene, especially at 4:01 the chemistry between the two is too cute"
"its really heartbreaking not to see them in any variety shows to promote their drama because of the controversy though JTBC has already made their statements to address the issue, so i guess us international fans we really need to hype the drama more"
"It sucks that Jisoo's first big acting project came with a lot of controversy, it seems like the public opinion is shifting for the good but there's still a good part still against the drama"
I think international fans need to understand that just because it is fiction doesn't justify the story it tells. You don't make a drama about the holocaust where a nazi is glorified. Or a drama about 9/11 where a terrorist is glorified.
"I honestly felt like the drama will be cancelled. The controvery already happened, I guess it will be an additional charm of Snowdrop"
"this kdrama was amazing I watched it from beginning to the end, and just as stated it was fictional. I literally cried for all the characters, except college girl lol she was so annoying."
"I used to think that it is rude to use word ""fiction"" to defend the drama. But, I didn't see what they accused to the drama."
"Okay, the problem is actually really complicated. Korean fans aren't really that angry at Jisoo or Haein (except for the antis who were always there and just found something to enjoy). They're just really concerned with the hisotrical events as well as the political problem right now that is kind of present in the plo"
How disappointing that a Korean would shamelessly participate in a TV show that twists their own country's history. I'm here after watching Snowdrop and I was shocked because I thought Jisoo knew better.
"It’s not the cast, historical controversy, or what not that killed it for me. The first 4 episodes were phenomenal!"
"I don't really know Korean history, so I can't really speak on that. I'm sorry that some feel so bad about this kdrama. "
"The story is riveting, the acting is so good and I'm hooked. I'm so excited to see where they take this story, controversy aside."
"f they had promoted this as ""based on true events"" or ""historical events"", then it would be understandable for people to be outraged."
THIS CONTROVERSY SHOWS HOW MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA CAN RUIN A GOOD PLOT DRAMA !!
"During the first few episodes of this drama, I was really annoyed by the political parts."
never thought such dramatic series can be this good
"the character visualization is fantastic, the story was emotional"
"I losed it here, I’m not the one who cries a lot in kdrama but this scene had me when she said “I’m Okay!"
i am very sad that the drama ended this way but im super happy about the success of jisoo's first acting debut and success of snowdrop itself!
"The whole season I waited for him to confess his love. I have no words for this series. Still if I have then - stunned, emotionally shook, relieved but sad"
"Oh how sad, but it really couldn’t have ended otherwise"
"Jung hae in deserves an Oscar Award. For real. At the End he cried. He expresses His while Feelings, sadness ,fear at the End. That Character was always manly"
seriously this made me cry for a whole of 3 hours and I still can't get over this ending.
What they have going through is just worth to both live and had a happy ending ever after
"i am dropping the drama after knowing soo ho dies. It's a waste of time if there's no happy ending, are the writers planning to give us depression and anxiety?"
snowdrop has became one of the series that has very heartbreaking and depressing ending but also gave us one of the best performances from Jung Haein and Jisoo
Jung Hae In deserves every acting award there is
they left a legacy in terms of passion in acting that will be remembered forever
