  In this project, we will be using two datasets(reviews.csv , input.csv) one for training and testing, and other for movie rating.
  
  We will train a lstm model using reviews dataset. This dataset consists of reviews and their polarities. This dataset consists of 20k reviews.
  
  We collected 30 reviews related to snowdrop web series and stored them in input.csv. Once the model is trained, we will give this input.csv to the model. then the model will predict polarities for these reviews.
  The web series rating will be calculated using the polarities.
